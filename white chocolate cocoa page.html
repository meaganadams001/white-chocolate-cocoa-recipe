		<p> <b>  Author Notes: </b> For those who don't normally like white chocholate- seriously: try it as coca. It's the perfect way to enjoy the incredible creaminess that white chocolate has. Make sure to use a good quality one- and if you're feeling naughty add just a liiiiiiitle bit of cream. Finished with a hint of grated nutmeg is my favorite way to drink it. -<b>Erin McDowell</b></p>

		<h3><b>Makes 1 cup of cocoa</b></h3>
			<blockquote>
				<ul>
					<li><b>3</b> ounces white chocolate, chopped</li>
					<li><b>1</b> cup whole milk</li>
					<li><b>1</b> tablespoon heavy cream</li>
						<p>Fresh grated nutmeg, to taste (optional)</p>
				</ul>

			</blockquote>

			<ol> 
				<li> Place the white chocolate in a heaty safe bowl or liquid measuring cup.</li>
				<li> Bring the milk, cream, and nutmeg if using, to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Pour the hot mild over the while chocolate and let sit for 15 seconds.</li>
				<li> Whisk the mixture until the chocholate is fully melted and the cocoa is smooth (if you whisk vigourously, the mixure will get frothy and if you mix slowly, it will stay smoother). Pour into a mug and drink warm.</li>
				</ol>
